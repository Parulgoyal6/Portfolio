# Portfolio
Welcome to My Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills as a MERN stack developer with additional expertise in Java, SQL, and DataStructure. These projects reflect my journey in full-stack development, problem-solving, and creating robust, scalable applications.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack This portfolio highlights various technologies that I specialize in, including:

Express.js: Backend web framework used for building RESTful APIs and middleware applications. HTML, CSS: Frontend JavaScript library used for building dynamic user interfaces and handling state management. Node.js: Server-side runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the backend. Java: Strong programming language used in various back-end applications and enterprise solutions. SQL & MySQL: Relational database systems for structured data handling and complex queries.

üîç Skills Showcased: Frontend Development: Expertise in building interactive, user-friendly interfaces with React.js and handling state management efficiently. Backend Development: Strong understanding of RESTful API design, middleware, and security protocols using Node.js and Express.js. Database Management: Proficiency in both NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL (MySQL, SQL) databases to handle data management, optimization, and complex queries. Java Programming: Advanced knowledge of Java for backend systems, data structures, algorithms, and enterprise applications. Full-Stack Development: End-to-end development skills in creating, deploying, and maintaining applications across multiple platforms. üöÄ How to Run the Projects To run any of the projects locally:

Clone the repository. Install the required dependencies using npm install for Node.js projects, or appropriate setup commands for Java projects. Set up the databases (MongoDB, MySQL) if necessary, following the setup instructions provided in each project's README. Run the application using npm start for MERN projects or the relevant command for Java-based applications. üí° Why This Portfolio? This portfolio serves as a testament to my versatility and ability to work with both modern JavaScript frameworks (MERN) and traditional programming languages like Java. My focus is on building scalable, efficient solutions that cater to real-world problems, whether through web applications, backend services, or enterprise-grade systems.
